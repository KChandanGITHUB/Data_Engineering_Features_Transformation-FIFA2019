# Data_Engineering_Features_Transformation-FIFA2019
- This exercise aims to perform a data engineering process to remove anomalies or discrepancies in the data, ensure free-flowing data to the model building process, and perform feature engineering to reduce the number of features. In this exercise, I have used FIFA 2019 data which is available in Kaggle.
